            <h4>21 Months of Full-Time Experience?</h4>
            <p align="justify">I have worked 3 full-time software development interships in the past 3 years as a part of earning my undergraduate degree ammounting in 21 months of experience (These internships are called co-ops). The first co-op was with Goldman Sachs and the second and third co-ops were with an inbound marketing automation company called HubSpot. The details of these co-ops are described below. I learned as much if not more on these co-ops than I do when I am in classes, and the experience has helped me to focus my studies and reaffirmed that I am certainly in the right field.</p> 
            <p align="justify">Each co-op presented different challenges, both technically and professionally and I have no doubt that the experience Iâ€™ve gained will be invaluable as I seek full-time employment for July 2017.</p>
